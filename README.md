- Swift 4.2+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Segnify into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.3'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Segnify', '~> 1.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Segnify into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "nedap/Segnify" ~> 1.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Segnify.framework` into your Xcode project.
